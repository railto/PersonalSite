            <p class="text-white mt-4">
                At the end of 2013 I got bitten by the bug that is web development and ever since I've been hooked. I
                love improving my programming abilities and am generally willing to try anything twice (within reason).
            </p>

            <p class="text-white mt-4">
                Over the years I've worked with a few different programming languages, namely PHP, JavaScript,
                TypeScript and also some Python. I'm most comfortable building back end server based systems, but over
                the last couple of years I've also been experimenting more with front end development work and thanks to
                the React and Vue libraries I'm starting to feel a bit more comfortable on the front end of things as
                well.
            </p>

                If you've visited this site before, you'll likely know that I tend to use it as a bit of a playground.
                Currently, it's built using Laravel, a powerful PHP Framework. The front end styling is done using
                Tailwind CSS, an excellent utility based CSS framework that's making it a bit easier to get a good
                design going. I've also managed to sprinkle in some JavaScript thanks to the AlpineJS library.
